- 👋 Hi, I’m @snhmibby
- 👀 I’m interested in ... data structures, writing clean readable and efficient programs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... golang
- 📫 How to reach me ... find me!

I try to code something every few years to try to get back into it. It used to be my hobby when I was younger.

I have a habit of losing all my programs, backup and configuration every once in a while, hence this github account.

At the moment (2021) i'm trying to learn golang by attempting to write a simple gui hex editor for large files.
