- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @snhmibby
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... data structures, writing clean readable and efficient programs
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... go!! (and CSS, yuk :S)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... once I bite the bullet and learn CSS properly I'll have a web spot at https://jurjen.dev, mail me at [info@jurjen.dev](mailto:info@jurjen.dev) 

I've been coding and playing with computers on and off since I can remember.

My favourite languages used to be C and Haskell, but now it's GO!
Go is like C, or BSD's... It's not as fancy as some, but it sure as heck is simple and fun :)

I've messed with anything from (visual) Basic to C to Haskell to CSS and Javascript... And everything in between.
