- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @snhmibby
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... data structures, writing clean readable and efficient programs
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... golang
- ğŸ“« How to reach me ... find me!

I try to code something every few years to try to get back into it. It used to be my hobby when I was younger.

I have a habit of losing all my programs, backup and configuration every once in a while, hence this github account.

My favourite languages used to be C and Haskell.
At the moment (2021) i'm trying to learn Golang and quite like it.
