- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @snhmibby
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... data structures, distributed programming, writing clean readable and efficient programs
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Go (the language) and web development (html, css, javascript,tools & frameworks)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... Find me at https://www.jurjen.dev, for info, [mail me](mailto:info@jurjen.dev) 

I've been coding and playing with computers on and off since I can remember.

My favourite languages used to be C and Haskell, but now it's GO!
Go is like C, or BSD's... It's not as fancy as some, but it sure as heck is simple and fun :)

I've messed with anything from (visual) Basic to C to Haskell to CSS and Javascript... And everything in between.
