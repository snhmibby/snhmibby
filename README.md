I've been coding and playing with computers on and off since I can remember.

My favourite languages used to be C and Haskell, but now it's GO!
Go is like C, or BSD's... It's not as fancy as some, but it sure as heck is simple and fun :)

I've messed with anything from (visual) Basic to C to Haskell to CSS and Javascript... And everything in between.
